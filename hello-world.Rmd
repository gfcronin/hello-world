```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```



[//]: tip: use the following if you wish to ensure .md and/or .html file to be created even whan R coding errors occur. Good when you actually want R coding error messgae to appear in your Rmarkdown
[//]: ```{r setup, include = FALSE, cache = FALSE}  
[//]: knitr::opts_chunk$set(error = TRUE)

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
